# ARound_HackMIT

##Inspiration
For people coming into the big cities or countries for travel or business purposes for the first time, ,they might want to decide where they would like to stay during their visit. They might check online for different hotel options, but even with 360 Degree view of the rooms, it doesnt give them the ultimate experience. 

##What it does
We are building an AR Application, which enables a user to enter any room in a 3D space and actually navigate inside the room and get a much better looking experience to help them decide the best hotel for them. Sitting at home, they can get a first hand experience of the rooms of all hotels. Therefore it becomes easier to decide the room of their choice. 
WHat we also plan to implement is adding new items within the room according to how the user wants, to customize the room further according to the user personalization. 
In theory, this added information will motivate the annotator to remain consistent when labelling data points and also to be aware of the labels that other annotators have assigned to a datapoint.

##How we built it
The project utilises Amadeus's Hotel Information API to get information about the hotels in a particular area. We also used Google AR Core and Unity 3D to build our AR product, while the rest of our Android Product was built using Java and Android Studio. 

##Challenges we faced
The biggest challenge right now is to get a 3d footage of a roo without a 3d camera, because even conversion of such a footage to a 3d model isnt that difficult a task. 

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to deploy our 3d model and actually interact inside the room, rather than just looking at a room. 

##What we learnt
Learning to work collectively in a team despite of the cultural differences is something we learnt really quickly. Effective communication is super important when desgning any project. To avoid lack of clarity and build up of arguements, it is very important to listen to everyone carefully, before putting up your arguements.
